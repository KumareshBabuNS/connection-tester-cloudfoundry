# A connection tester for Cloud Foundry
To validate if a certain external service is reachable from your Cloud Foundry instance, you normally would like to send a kind of `ping` from there. The easiest way to do so is [CF SSH](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/ssh-apps.html).

However, if your Ops admin disabled CF SSH, the Cloud Foundry Connection Tester becomes handy.  
The tester can also be used in other clouds and remote servers, since it is written in Java and reads [an environment variable](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/env.html).

## Usage
1. Download the app here.
2. Push it to the cloud:  
```cf push connection-test --no-route --no-start -p cloudfoundry-connection-tester.jar -u none```
3. Configure the target URL (without schema):  
```cf set-env connection-test URL "www.google.com:80"```
4. Start the app:  
```cf start connection-test```  
CF will report the app as *crashed* because it shuts itself down after the test.
5. Stop the app:  
```cf stop connection-test```
6. Find the test result in the logs:  
```cf logs connection-test --recent```

## Understanding the test result

Being a good 12-factor-app the Connection Tester prints its logs to Standard Out and Standard Error.  
You can display the most recent logs by using: ```cf logs connection-test --recent```.  
Or you can monitor the log output live during the app's execution in a second terminal: ```cf logs connection-test``.

### Successful connection

> OUT Creating container  
> OUT Successfully created container  
> OUT Starting health monitoring of container  
> OUT Read URL from environment variables: "www.google.de:80"  
> OUT Trying to connect (timeout: 10000 milliseconds)...  
> OUT Connecting to "www.google.de:80" was successful!  
> OUT Exit status 0  

### Blocked connection

> OUT Creating container  
> OUT Successfully created container  
> OUT Starting health monitoring of container  
> OUT Read URL from environment variables: "www.google.de:80"  
> OUT Trying to connect (timeout: 10000 milliseconds)...  
> ERR Connecting to "www.google.de:80" failed!  
> OUT Exit status 0
