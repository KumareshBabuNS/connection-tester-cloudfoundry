# A connection tester for Cloud Foundry
To validate if a certain external service is reachable from your Cloud Foundry instance, you would naturally like to send a kind of `ping` from there. The easiest way to do so is [CF SSH](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/ssh-apps.html).

However, if you Ops admin disabled CF SSH, the Cloud Foundry Connection Tester becomes handy.  
The tester can also be used in other clouds and remote servers, since it is written in Java and reads a [system property](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/sysprop.html).

## Usage
1. Download the app here.
2. Push it to the cloud: ```cf push connection-test --no-route --no-start -p cloudfoundry-connection-tester.jar```
3. Configure the target URL (without schema): ```cf set-env connection-test URL "www.google.com:80"```
4. Start the app: ```cf start connection-test```
5. Find the test result in the logs.
6. Stop the app: ```cf stop connection-test```
